This code was developed to perform a frequency analysis of function usage
in standard R source code. You will need functioning copies of Perl, Ruby and
R to use the code. The spidering code will download all of the packages
currently on CRAN to your local machine; this code is in Perl and uses the
WWW:Mechanize library. The tokenization code is written in Ruby; it has no
external dependencies. Finally, the analysis code is written in R and depends
upon the ggplot2 package to generate graphs.

To follow the steps you need to take to replicate these results, work through
the usage.sh script, which needs to be slightly edited before it can be run.
